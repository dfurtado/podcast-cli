What prompted me to write this review is something that Sean said in the Christmas episode this year.. To not wast too much time listening to ALL of his stuff.. That if you did that you would have no time to take action.. Great sound advice! Most podcasters I think just want you to consume with no action taken. What Sean is trying to do hear is inspire people to walk the walk!! \nIt’s made me start. Podcast and video cast in my field ad we are 54 episodes in!! I won’t plug it here..

                                        kinds of spaces, from a small payroll company to a digital marketing agency, and

                                        Memberships right now are thriving, bigtime. In fact, we at SPI are working on

                                        this opportunity and even how to validate a membership idea and how to get

                                        parent entrepreneur friends a few questions about owning your own business and
                                        working at home. Then, the unprecedented health crisis of 2020 happened, and
                                        they found themselves in even closer quarters with their kids. You&#39;ll learn
                                        tips, plans, strategies, and tools for juggling family and business, and how to
                                        ask for forgiveness when the inevitable ball does fall. Podcast show notes

                                      <p dir=false data-test-bidi>#417: In this episode with talk with Michael Hyatt.
                                        His new book, The Vision Driven Leader, just came out and Michael talks about
                                        the ideas in the book and how he came to be such a successful and admired
                                        leader. You&#39;ll learn: which opportunities are relevant and which are
                                        distractions, why it is a mistake to take action without first thinking about
                                        your vision, and what a vision actually is. Read show notes here:

                            <p dir=false data-test-bidi>I love Pat. He’s one of my virtual mentors even though he might
                              not know it. His podcast(s) has helped and provided me the guidance, courage, and
                              knowledge to start and run my business. His podcast is definitely the best out there.
                              <br /><br />Why?<br />1. Each episode is not too long. They’re concise and filled with
                              value. <br />2. Pat does not spam his ads/sponsorships over the episodes.<br />3. Pat is
                              such an honest and humble person. <br /><br />Thanks Pat! Been meaning to leave this
                              review for a long time but I have been using a different app to listen. I just
                              re-downloaded Apple’s app and here’s my review. <br /><br />Love from Malaysia 🇲🇾!
                              (Probably the only Malaysian who listens to your show 😆)<br /><br />PS: I’m a Cal Poly
